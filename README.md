# Stroke Prediction
This repository contains my submissions to a Kaggle competition, in which I attained first place. 

This is a Kaggle competition to predict deaths in the International Stroke Trial. The training set includes information about 9,762 patients within the trial. The test set includes related information about 9,558 additional patients. The goal of this competition is to predict whether each patient was still living or not six months after the initial event.

### Acknowledgments
This dataset comes from the International Stroke Trial Database found in journals published by BioMed Central. The data collection was funded primarily by the UK Medical Research Council, the UK Stroke Association, and the European Union BIOMED-1 program. The data was collected and coordinated with the help of the Neurosciences Trials Unit, the Clinical Trial Service Unit in Oxford, and thousands of patients and their doctors.

### Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric for this competition is Classification Accuracy. A score is calculated by determining the number of correct predictions and dividing this number by the total number of predictions made.
